# Traffy

An Arduino-powered robotic dog that listens to ambient sound and reacts in real time. Wagging its tail when it's quiet, perking up its ears when it hears something, and barking back when things get loud.

## Demo behavior

| Loudness | LED | Ears | Tail | Buzzer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Quiet (`< 4`) | Green | Down | Wagging | — |
| Mid (`≥ 4`) | Blue | Half-up | Still | — |
| Loud (`≥ 7`) | Red | Up | Still | Bark |

## Hardware

| Component | Model | Pin |
|---|---|---|
| Microcontroller | ELEGOO UNO R3 | — |
| Microphone amplifier | MAX4466 | A0 |
| RGB LED (common cathode) | — | 3 (R), 5 (G), 6 (B) |
| Tail servo | SG90 | 9 |
| Ear servo | SG90 | 11 |
| Passive buzzer | — | 10 |

> **Power note:** Two servos drawing current simultaneously can cause voltage dips on the Arduino 5 V rail. Consider powering the servos from a separate 5 V supply (shared GND) if you observe resets or erratic behavior.

## How to build & upload

1. Open `ReactingDog.ino` in the **Arduino IDE** (≥ 1.8) or **Arduino IDE 2**.
2. Make sure the `Servo` library is available - it ships with the IDE by default.
3. Select your board (**Tools → Board**) and port (**Tools → Port**).
4. Click **Upload** (Ctrl + U).
5. Open **Serial Monitor** at **9600 baud** to watch live loudness values.

## Calibration

Adjust the two thresholds in `ReactingDog.ino` to match your environment:

```cpp
const int THRESHOLD_LOUD = 6-8;  // peak-to-peak amplitude for "loud"
const int THRESHOLD_MID  =  3-4;  // peak-to-peak amplitude for "mid"
```

The `MicSensor` constructor also accepts custom sample count and window length:

```cpp
// 8 windows × 30 ms each for a smoother reading in noisy environments
MicSensor mic(A0, 8, 30);
```
